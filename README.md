# Streamlit Chatbot using Ollama Open Source LLMs (llama2)

The codebase has code for building Chatbot using the Streamlit Python library. For accessing LLMs, it uses the Ollama Python library which is a wrapper around Ollama REST APIs.

Ollama is a CLI tool that lets us run open-source LLMs on our computers for free.

Get started by installing Ollama, then : 

- Ollama pull llama2
    - Pull: Downloads the model to your local environment.
    - Run: Executes the model, allowing you to interact with it.
- install the requirements (streamlit and ollama), better to use a venv
- finally run 'chatbot.py' ðŸ¤– 

Note : you can choose your model llama2(7B) or 13B... according to your laptop performance.
